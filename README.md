# Fullstack exercise

This is an exercise about fullstack web development.

We expect you to have some prerequisite on :

- javascript
- React
- Express.js
- JWT

You should also have installed:

- node.js
- Yarn

## Context

Avosvotes is a french startup that is tending to encourage citizen participation through a next-generation dematerialized voting solution. Avosvotes is therefore developing a citizen consultation platform with two specificities, security (thanks to the blockchain) and the implementation of a know your customer (KYC) process with machine learning algorithm. 

For this exercice, we will develope a small securise voting web application. This application will allow citizens to fetch their personnal ID informations once they have authentificated themselves. Furthermore, a super administrator will be able to fetch the voting history to count the votes.

WARNING: Citizen's personnal ID information and voting history are extremely critical and confidential. A citizen must not be able to read or obtain another citizen's personnal ID information, and no one exept the super administrator can get the voting history.

Your goal here is to prove that you are capable to build and maintain a fullstack app in Javascript.
You should be particularly careful about security and the data privacy.

## Your task

In this repository you will find a server and a React app.
