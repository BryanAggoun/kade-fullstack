# Fullstack exercise

This is an exercise about fullstack web development.

We expect you to have some prerequisite on :

- javascript
- React
- Express.js

## Context

Avosvotes is a french startup that is tending to encourage citizen participation through a next-generation dematerialized voting solution. Avosvotes is therefore developing a citizen consultation platform with two specificities, security (thanks to the blockchain) and the implementation of a know your customer (KYC) process with machine learning algorithm. 

Your goal here is to prove that you are capable to build and maintain a fullstack app in Javascript.
You should be particularly careful about security and the data privacy.
